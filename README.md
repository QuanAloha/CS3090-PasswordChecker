# CS3090-PasswordChecker
 Password Checker for Block 2 Project

# What My Program Does

> This program accepts a potential password from a user that they are thinking about making and checks it against a list of 10_000 common passwords. It tells the user if their password is on this list or not. 

# How to Run this program

> For simplicity, I included the entire list inside of the python script. So just run the project as a normal script inside a python shell. 

# Limitation Warnings

> This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information. The password list has not been updsated in a few years and checking against 10_000 passwords is not as secure against checking against 1_000_000 passwords. 

# Ethical Considerations and Responsible Use

> This tool could be misused becasue it contains an un-encrypted and very easy to read list of common passwords. If someone wanted, they could brute force their way into an account by running all of these passwords against a login credential checker. Do not do this.
